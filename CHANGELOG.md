## [Unreleased]

## [0.3.0] - 2026-06-17

Fork by [@Faxtom](https://github.com/Faxtom) — based on [julianoczkowski/notebooklm-mcp-2026](https://github.com/julianoczkowski/notebooklm-mcp-2026).

### Added
- Multi-browser authentication (Chrome, Edge, Brave, Opera, Vivaldi, Firefox, Safari)
- First-class [Helium](https://github.com/imputnet/helium) browser support (cookie import + CDP login)
- `login --method browser` opens the browser automatically when no valid session is found
- `login` auto-verifies the account via real API call and configures MCP clients (no separate `setup` needed)
- Silent session refresh from installed browsers and persistent CDP profile
- `NOTEBOOKLM_BROWSER` and `NOTEBOOKLM_AUTH_REFRESH_COOLDOWN` environment variables
- Login flags: `--browser`, `--method`, `--skip-setup`, `--import-file`

### Changed
- `check_auth` validates credentials with a real `list_notebooks` API call
- `doctor` reports all detected browsers, not only Chrome
- README updated for the new one-command workflow

### Dependencies
- Added `browser-cookie3>=0.19.1`

## [0.2.1] - 2026-05-01

### Added
- Flow animation GIF in README
- Sponsor links: Buy Me a Coffee and Ko-fi (`.github/FUNDING.yml` + README badges)
- `/cleanup-branches` skill for post-merge branch cleanup
- `/sync-docs` skill to keep CLAUDE.md and CHANGELOG.md in sync
- Unit tests for `_launch_chrome` covering Windows multi-process launcher behavior

### Fixed
- Windows Chrome login crash: launcher process exits with code 0 immediately
  while the browser runs as a detached child. `_launch_chrome` now treats a
  code-0 exit as success when CDP is reachable, so login no longer fails on
  Windows (#19, thanks @WillWetzel)

## [0.2.0] - 2026-02-15

### Added
- Windows CI (ubuntu, macos, windows matrix)
- Code coverage with pytest-cov

- CODEOWNERS, PR template, issue templates
- Dependabot for pip and GitHub Actions dependencies
- `[project.urls]` in pyproject.toml (Homepage, Repository, Issues, Changelog)
- Example JSON outputs in README
